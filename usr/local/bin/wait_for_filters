# Check if the filters are ready for another reload (as indicated by the
# filter status register bits 0 and 4). If the filters aren't ready,
# send some data through them until they are.
# To get data through, use streamtonowhered. Note however that this
# will overwrite any previous transient capture data, so ensure that
# this data is safely stored elsewhere before runing this script
#
# For improved efficiency when loading multiple filters, start at stream to
# nowhere before running this script, and then pass "nospawn" as the first
# argument to the script. This will bypass spawning a new streamtonowhered
# process
